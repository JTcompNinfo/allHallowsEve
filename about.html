        <p>A little witch in steeple hat
            Once tried a merry spell,
            To make the hares come pit-a-pat
            From dingle and from dell.
            
            And pit-a-pat, beneath the moon,
            The shy hares peeping came;
            The little witch in buckled shoon,
            She called them each by name.
            
            "Come, 'Fairy-foot' and 'Sparkle-eyes'!
            Come, 'Fine-ear,' 'Bob,' and 'Bun'!"
            They gathered round in mild surprise,
            But glad of any fun.
            
            And when she told them what she willed,
            They stamped and leaped in glee,
            And all their velvet noses thrilled
            With laughter strange to see.
            
            What was the prank, do you suppose,
            And what the merry spell? â€•
            The sleepy owlet only knows,
            And she would never tell!
